<h4>About This Project </h4>
<h5>Our project is an app that allows both students and teachers to work better. This app is able to run efficiently off of any mobile device while the pupils are working and allows teachers to plan their lesson too. We understand that planning a lesson can be quite stressful with all of the paper work included. We decided to help with that problem by adding a section where teachers can plan the lesson. Students will not have to worry about getting lost as they will have both their timetable and school map on their account. Their homework can also be added on to it so it will always be there. We insure that our app is reliable, easy to use, will keep the students interested and will make lessons more fun!       </h5>
