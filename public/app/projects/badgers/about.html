<p> The Micro-Finder could help owners across the world re-unite with their 4 legged
friends faster with more luck. If we gain the money to produce our product, for every 
product sold we will donate $10 to helping animal shelters across the world fund and
also keep lost pets out of them and with their owners. </p>
<p> Our product is targeted to help dog owners world wide through the means of a tracking chip
for in the scenario that their dog becomes lost, it can be located and tracked via an app installed
which locks on to the tracker. </p>
