<p>We are Lights Off, a brand new app that enables you to control and measure how much energy you are using. It can help you to save money on your energy bills as you can get alerts both at home and on the go when you are using too much electricity. It works on: </p>
<p>~ Lights</P>
<p>~ TV</P>
<p>~ Other electric household appliances</P></p>
<p>It has been proven that it significantly reduced household energy bills. And it's not just for your home, it can be used in schools to measure how much electricity is being used in a classroom.</p>
<p>Helen, 34 "This app has revolutionised the way my school uses energy. It has successfully encouraged students to recycle, turn off the lights and let in natural daylight into their classrooms. We have used it as a competition over the school, where each class has to try and use the least energy. Thanks to the Jailbreak Jaguars for making such a great app. 10/10"</p>
